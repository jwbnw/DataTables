# DataTables
This program is dedicated to building the ablity to read in .csv files, construct data-tables, compare values in data tables then return certain values from the table.

Update: 11/14/217 I forked this from my old github (mainly b/c I just found it and remembered writing this one back in college). I may add some functionality..JSON?.... if I get around to it!
